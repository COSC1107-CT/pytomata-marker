# Pytomata-marker

This is a re-make of the Java-based [JFLAP Automarker](https://github.com/COSC1107-CT/jflap-ct-automarker) done now in Python using the [automata library](https://caleb531.github.io/automata/).

It allows the automarking of exercises in classical Theory of Computation courses, mostly on correctness of automata and regular expressions.
